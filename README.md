Joomla! 3.x Template built From Scratch - Tutorial for Webdesigner Magazine
================================

This Joomla! 3.x template is created for a tutorial in the Dutch Webdesigner magazine (www.webdesignermagazine.nl) and will be published in April 2015.

The tutorial explains step by step the creation of your own Joomla! 3.x template. It makes use of **Bootstrap** and the **'Joomla User Interface'** (JUI) Library. 

The result is a solid Joomla! template which can be expanded any way you like. Below a couple of examples where this template is used:
